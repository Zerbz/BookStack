Base BookStack codebase with custom Favorites functionality. Migrate after cloning and you're good to go. 

Please note this was done hastily and has not been properly tested for prod use. Please report any issues or suggestions that you may have. The same functionality is available for BookStack v0.25.1 upon request.
